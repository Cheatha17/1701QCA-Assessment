(Fun Theory Piano)

This project is related to mine because it includes a muscial aspect that others can interact with and enjoy. I find it an intersting project because it encourages people to take the more active route on their travels.


### Related project 2 ###
(QUT Cube)

This project is related to mine because it brings something realistic to the public. The cube offers and provides an experience to witness things such as the Great Barrier Reef as if people were really there. My project provides someone who can't play guitar, such as myself, a chance of experincing something even remotely closer to the real thing.

This project is related to mine because the owners of the centre explain that it is a revitalise that customers willbe excited to see and be apart of. I see that in my project as well. While it still appears to be a rough prototype replication, it concept of it does "spruce" things up from a ordinary guitar as this is more of an electronic instrument. Even better, it's home made. 

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

## Process documentation

To begin my project, I first had to find some inspiration on the type of shape and type of guitar I wanted to recreate in terms of appearance. This was more so the creative aesthetic side instead of the technical side. I chose to go with a fender electric stratocaster guitar. Wasn't anything particular about it, it's just the shape was more appealing to me. However, I didn't achieve the full look as I lacked in materials to decorate with as my top priority was having it function.

Below are the materials I used which I got from referring from the link that was provided in the assesment template. Most of which were household items. Note that some things in the image are missing but were later collected (such as aluminuium foil).

A problem I was stuck with for a bit was getting my hands on crocodile jumper heads. This came due to my lack of knowledge and experience. I wasn't aware the Inventor's kit didn't provide them, so I had to take it upon myself to go out and find them. These were sourced from Bunnings Warehouse. Due to these being very different from the ones used in class and my lack of knowledge, I had no idea how to connect the heads with the wires provided with the kit. I sourced out youtube videos, in hopes that it would help... they did not as the wires were different. I later played around with the heads and wires and soon found out how they worked.

I first made an outline of my guitar on a flattened out piece of cardboard (which was originally boxed). The recommended length was about 40-80cm. Mine was roughly 82.5cm, serving a good size. 

Complications came with cutting out the shape, which found itself to be very time consuming. I found this due to the tools I was using. The scissors used weren't best suited for cardboard, which left small pains in my hand after a couple of cuts. The stanely knife wasn't sharp enough, therefore a couple of strides were needed to cut through.

I sensed the use of using cardboard that was originally boxed left it very flimsy, however this was a quick fix, as extra layers or cardboard and tape were used to create a sturdier material.

### Project title ###
GUITAR REPLICATION

### Project description ###

This project is a electronic musical instrument in hopes to bring a close real life feel to playing an actual guitar. This project makes it so that anyone can play any instrument. 

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

Overall the replication of the project was successful. Plenty room for improvement seeing as it was my first design project. One of the highlights was teaching myself new things (that may seem small) like wiring up crocodile heads with wires. However the most successful thing to come out of this is having the guitar show its function. 

However, though the replication was successful, there are still some aspects that were hard to work around or figure out. For example coding, I found throughout this process, it took me a while to understand why things were put together the way they were. Or some things just didn't work through the microbit. ALthough these weren't any major problems that stopped the central goal of having it work and play sounds. It still would have been a rewarding feeling knowing i accomplised all of it. 

One of my coding problems was the "on" and "off" switch, which didn't seem to work. I followed the steps provided, however as I am new to all of this, I may have coded incorrectly or placed wires in the wrong sections. 

Looking back at this whole process, I would recommended to myself to explore more sources to see if there were other alternatives or approaches for more inspiration. Now realising I'm not as limited to what I thought I was. 

Looking back at it now I wish there was a more pleasing aesthetic look to it. Keeping in mind for next time that the look of it should be considered and thought out as much as the technical side.
